Project Description: Image Classification for Food Recognition using Food-101 Dataset
This project aims to develop an image classification model to recognize various types of food items using the Food-101 dataset. The dataset comprises 101,000 images across 101 categories, with 750 training images and 250 test images per class.

Objectives:

Data Collection: Download and extract the Food-101 dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and apply data augmentation.
Model Architecture: Utilize the MobileNetV2 CNN architecture for efficient classification.
Transfer Learning: Fine-tune the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for food classification.
Model Training: Train the model with the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy on the test dataset.
Visualization: Display model predictions and explore misclassified images.

Steps:
Data Collection: The dataset is downloaded from the official Food-101 website and extracted.
Data Preprocessing: Images are resized to 150x150 pixels, normalized, and augmented to enhance generalization.
Model Architecture: MobileNetV2, pre-trained on ImageNet, is adapted by adding GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense layers, and a softmax layer.
Transfer Learning: The pre-trained layers of MobileNetV2 are frozen, and the top layers are trained on the Food-101 dataset.
Model Training: The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, and trained for 10 epochs.
Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy and loss are evaluated on the validation dataset.
Visualization: Predictions are visualized, highlighting true and predicted labels to identify misclassifications.

Tools and Technologies:
Python: Programming language for the project.
TensorFlow and Keras: Frameworks for building and training the model.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib: For visualizing images and predictions.

Expected Outcomes:
A trained model capable of accurately identifying food items from images.
Visualizations showing the model's predictions and misclassifications.
Insights into the application of transfer learning for image classification.
This project showcases the process of building an image classification model using deep learning and transfer learning techniques, leveraging the extensive Food-101 dataset for training and evaluation.
