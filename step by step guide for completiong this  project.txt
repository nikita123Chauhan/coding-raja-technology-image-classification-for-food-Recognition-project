/*.....................................Image classification for food recogonization  step to be taken for completinf this project.......................*/

------------Explanation of Each Step--------------------
1.Download the Dataset:
     The script checks if the dataset is already downloaded. If not, it downloads the Food-101 dataset.
    
2.Extract the Dataset.
   the scripts extracts the dataset from the tar.gz file.

3.Data Preprocessing:
   script reads class names and train/test splits.
   It sets up ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and normalization.

4.Model Architecture:
   The script uses MobileNetV2 as the base model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet.
   It adds global average pooling and dense layers on top of the base model.

5.Model Training:
   The model is compiled and trained using the training data.

6.Model Evaluation:
  The script evaluates the model on the validation data and prints the accuracy.

7.Visualization:
   The script visualizes some of the predictions made by the model, showing the true labels and predicted labels.


*-----------Using an IDE---------------*
Using Jupyter Notebook

1.Install Jupyter: If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using:
       /-----give this command-----------/
        pip install jupyter

2.Convert Script to Notebook: You can convert the script to a Jupyter notebook by copying the code into a new notebook cell-by-cell.

3.Run Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
        /------give this command---------/
          jupyter notebook

       Navigate to the notebook file and execute the cells sequentially.

By following these steps, you will have a complete project for food image classification using the Food-101 dataset.
